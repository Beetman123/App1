Fixed Bugs in Sprint 1: Login didn't work - (Because of backend) see below Register didn't work - (Because of backend) see below backend didn't work - Had to start over with my backend from the labs Bottom bar didn't have a default fragment page - I set the SearchFragment as the default

Device Storage: I implemented device storage for the sharedPreferances, in the login where they could select if they wanted to be logged in automaticly the next time, doing anything short of deleteing and reinstalling the app will stop the app from automaticly logging you in.

Content Sharing: To use content sharing, go to the the SearchFragment (Search icon) there is a button in the bottom right of each item in the recycler view, by clicking that you can chose where to share the item information.

User Stories: As a user, I want to Sign up so that I can start using the app.
- This was accomplished

As a user, I want to login in so that I can use the app.
- This was accomplished

As a user, I want to post a trade offer so that I can possibly get a trade item in return - This was accomplished >> Users are able to add items to the recycler view and the backend list

As a user, I want to search for trades so that I can look for something that I want
- We have a list of items currently but you can't quite "search" through them yet

As a user, I want to make an offer to trade so that I can possibly get the item.
- People are able to send the information about item trade offers to people they know currently but are unable to comuncate with the user that posted the trade

As a user, I want to respond to an offer so that I can barter for a better trade. - The users aren't able to communicate with each other yet
